Hi [[menteeName]],

You changed your mind and cancelled the request for a [[longOrShortTerm]] mentorship with the mentor [[mentorName]].

This is ok, but should not happen often!

Mentors offer their time on a volunteer basis and we'd like to lower their wasted time on the platform.

Have a great day,
Tupu App Team
