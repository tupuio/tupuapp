Hi [[mentorName]],

The mentee [[menteeName]] changed their mind and cancelled the request for a [[longOrShortTerm]] mentorship with you.

This is ok, there might be several reasons for this (e.g. wrong click), please do not take this personally.

We are all here to learn.

This should not happen many time! Keep an eye on these kind of episodes and notify the Tupu App team in case you suspect an abuse of the platform.

Have a great day,
Tupu App Team
